## Google Cloud Project Setup

GCP organizes resources into projects. This allows you to
collect all of the related resources for a single application in one place.

Begin by creating a new project or selecting an existing project for this
dashboard.

<walkthrough-project-setup billing></walkthrough-project-setup>

For details, see
[Creating a project](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#creating_a_project).

### Enable Google Cloud APIs

Enable the Google Ads API and the BigQuery API so that they're incorporated in the credentials you will generate in the next step.

<walkthrough-enable-apis apis="bigquery.googleapis.com,googleads.googleapis.com,youtube.googleapis.com,cloudfunctions.googleapis.com,cloudscheduler.googleapis.com,workflows.googleapis.com,run.googleapis.com,cloudbuild.googleapis.com,cloudaicompanion.googleapis.com,generativelanguage.googleapis.com">
</walkthrough-enable-apis>


## Switch Off Ephemeral Mode

First, let's switch off your shell's ephemeral mode.

Click <walkthrough-spotlight-pointer spotlightId="cloud-shell-more-button" target="cloudshell" title="Show me where">**More**</walkthrough-spotlight-pointer> and look for the `Ephemeral Mode` option. If it is turned on turn it off. This allows the dashboard code to persist across sessions.

## Authorize shell scripts commands

Copy the following command into the shell, press enter and follow the instructions:
```bash
cd
git clone https://github.com/google-marketing-solutions/dgpulse.git
cd dgpulse
gcloud auth login
```


## Configure OAuth Consent Screen

An authorization token is needed for the dashboard to communicate with Google Ads.

1.  Go to the **APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen** page in the Cloud
    Console. You can use the button below to find the section.

    <walkthrough-menu-navigation sectionId="API_SECTION;metropolis_api_consent"></walkthrough-menu-navigation>

1.  Choose **External** as the user type for your application.

    *   If you have an organization for your application, select **Internal**.
    *   If you don't have an organization configured for your application,
        select **External**.

1.  Click
    <walkthrough-spotlight-pointer cssSelector="button[type='submit']">**Create**</walkthrough-spotlight-pointer>
    to continue.

1.  Under *App information*, enter the **Application name** you want to display.
    You can copy the name below and enter it as the application name.

    ```
    DemandGen-Pulse
    ```

1.  For the **Support email** dropdown menu, select the email address you want
    to display as a public contact. This email address must be your email
    address, or a Google Group you own.
2.  Under **Developer contact information**, enter a valid email address.

Click
    <walkthrough-spotlight-pointer cssSelector=".cfc-stepper-step-continue-button">**Save
    and continue**</walkthrough-spotlight-pointer>.

## Add Sensitive Scopes to Consent Screen

Scope the consent screen for Big Query API and the Google Ads API.

1. Click <walkthrough-spotlight-pointer locator="semantic({button 'Add or remove scopes'})">Add or remove scopes</walkthrough-spotlight-pointer>
1. Now in <walkthrough-spotlight-pointer locator="semantic({combobox 'Filter'})">Enter property name or value</walkthrough-spotlight-pointer> search for the BigQuery API, check the box for the first option to choose it.
1. Do the same for Google Ads API.
1. Click <walkthrough-spotlight-pointer locator="text('Update')">Update</walkthrough-spotlight-pointer>

## Creating OAuth Credentials

Create the credentials that are needed for generating a refresh token.

Make sure to **copy each of the credentials you create**, you will need them later.

1.  On the APIs & Services page, click the
    <walkthrough-spotlight-pointer cssSelector="#cfctest-section-nav-item-metropolis_api_credentials">**Credentials**</walkthrough-spotlight-pointer>
    tab.

1.  On the
    <walkthrough-spotlight-pointer cssSelector="[id$=action-bar-create-button]" validationPath="/apis/credentials">**Create
    credentials**</walkthrough-spotlight-pointer> drop-down list, select **OAuth
    client ID**.
1.  Under
    <walkthrough-spotlight-pointer cssSelector="[formcontrolname='typeControl']">**Application
    type**</walkthrough-spotlight-pointer>, select **Web application**.

1.  Add a
    <walkthrough-spotlight-pointer cssSelector="[formcontrolname='displayName']">**Name**</walkthrough-spotlight-pointer>
    for your OAuth client ID.

1. Click <walkthrough-spotlight-pointer locator="semantic({group 'Authorized redirect URIs'} {button 'Add URI'})">Authorized redirect URI</walkthrough-spotlight-pointer>
   and copy the following:
   ```
   https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground
   ```

1.  Click **Create**. Your OAuth client ID and client secret are generated and
    displayed on the OAuth client window.

After generating the client_id and client_secret keep the confirmation screen open and go to the next step.


## Generate Refresh Token

1. Go to the [OAuth2 Playground](https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground/#step1&scopes=https%3A//www.googleapis.com/auth/adwords&url=https%3A//&content_type=application/json&http_method=GET&useDefaultOauthCred=checked&oauthEndpointSelect=Google&oauthAuthEndpointValue=https%3A//accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth&oauthTokenEndpointValue=https%3A//oauth2.googleapis.com/token&includeCredentials=unchecked&accessTokenType=bearer&autoRefreshToken=unchecked&accessType=offline&forceAprovalPrompt=checked&response_type=code) (opens in a new window)
2. On the right-hand pane, paste the client_id and client_secret in the appropriate fields ![paste credentials](https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/pplayground_fields.png)
3. Then on the left hand side of the screen, click the blue **Authorize APIs** button ![Authorize APIs](https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/authorize_apis.png)

   If you are prompted to authorize access, please choose your Google account that has access to Google Ads and approve.
   
5. Now, click the new blue button **Exchange authorization code for tokens** ![Exchange authorization code for tokens](https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/exchange_authorization_code_for_token.png)
6. Finally, in the middle of the screen you'll see your refresh token on the last line.  Copy it and save it for future reference.  ![refresh_token](https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/refresh_token.png) *Do not copy the quotation marks*
